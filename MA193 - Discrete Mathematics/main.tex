\chapter{Fundamental Principles of Counting}

\section{Counting with Repetitions}

\nt{
	These notes cover the basic counting principles (often called the
	``Rule of Sum'' and the ``Rule of Product''), along with a brief
	discussion of permutations and combinations, including the formula
	for permutations of multiset objects (i.e., repeated elements).
}

\dfn{Rule of Sum (``OR'')}{
	If a certain task can be done in \(n\) ways and another independent
	task can be done in \(m\) ways, and these tasks are mutually exclusive,
	then there are \(n + m\) ways to do \textit{one} of the two tasks.
}

\dfn{Rule of Product (``AND'')}{
	If a procedure can be broken into two consecutive steps such that
	the first step can be done in \(n\) ways and the second step can be
	done in \(m\) ways (independently of how the first step is done),
	then there are \(n \times m\) ways to do the entire procedure.
}

\nt{
	In many counting problems, we break a larger procedure into a series
	of smaller steps and then apply either the Rule of Sum or the Rule
	of Product (or both) as needed.
}

\dfn{Arrangements of \(n\) Distinct Objects}{
	If you want to arrange \(n\) distinct objects in a row (i.e., an
	ordered list), there are \(n!\) ways to do so. Order matters here,
	and this number is referred to as the number of permutations of
	\(n\) distinct items.
}

\dfn{Permutations of Multisets}{
	Suppose we have \(n\) total objects, but they are not all distinct.
	Instead, let there be \(n_1\) objects of type 1, \(n_2\) objects of
	type 2, \(\dots\), and \(n_k\) objects of type \(k\). Clearly
	\[
		n_1 + n_2 + \cdots + n_k = n.
	\]
	Then the number of distinct ways to arrange all \(n\) objects is
	\[
		\frac{n!}{n_1! \, n_2! \, \dots \, n_k!}.
	\]
}

\ex{Examples of Counting with Repetitions}{
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{ABCD:} All letters are distinct, so the number of ways
		      to arrange A, B, C, D is
		      \[
			      4! = 24.
		      \]
		\item \textbf{AABC:} Here we have 4 total letters, with A repeated twice.
		      The number of distinct arrangements is
		      \[
			      \frac{4!}{2!} = \frac{24}{2} = 12.
		      \]
		\item \textbf{AABB:} Now we have 2 A's and 2 B's (4 letters total). The
		      number of arrangements is
		      \[
			      \frac{4!}{2! \, 2!} = \frac{24}{2 \times 2} = 6.
		      \]
		\item \textbf{SUCCESS:} The word ``SUCCESS'' has 7 letters total:
		      3 S's, 2 C's, 1 U, and 1 E. The number of distinct permutations is
		      \[
			      \frac{7!}{3! \, 2! \, 1! \, 1!} = \frac{5040}{(6)(2)(1)(1)} = 420.
		      \]
	\end{enumerate}
}

\section*{Committee-Choosing Problems}

\dfn{Combinations}{
	A \emph{combination} is a way to choose \(r\) objects from \(n\) distinct
	objects where order does \emph{not} matter. The number of ways to do
	so is given by
	\[
		\binom{n}{r} \;=\; \frac{n!}{r! \,(n-r)!}.
	\]
	In many committee-selection problems, we use combinations because the
	particular order in which people are chosen does not matter.
}

\dfn{When to Use Permutations vs.\ Combinations}{
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \emph{Permutations} (\(P(n,r)\) or \(\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\)) are used
		      when we care about the \emph{order} of the chosen items (for instance,
		      arranging people in a line for a photo).
		\item \emph{Combinations} (\(\binom{n}{r}\)) are used when we only care
		      about \emph{which} items are chosen, not the order in which they appear
		      (e.g., forming committees).
	\end{itemize}
}

\dfn{Basic Subset Counting}{
	Note that the total number of distinct subsets of a set with \(n\)
	elements is \(2^n\). This comes from the fact that, for each element,
	we independently choose to include it or not in a given subset.
	For an \(r\)-element subset, specifically, we use \(\binom{n}{r}\).
}

\ex{Choosing a Simple Committee}{
	Suppose we have 8 people in a group, and we want to choose a committee
	of 3 individuals. Since order does not matter, the number of ways to
	choose the committee is
	\[
		\binom{8}{3} \;=\; \frac{8!}{3!(8-3)!} \;=\; \frac{8!}{3!5!} \;=\; 56.
	\]
}

\ex{Committee with Restrictions: Gender Balance}{
	Imagine we have 5 men and 6 women, and we want to form a committee of 4
	people that has at least 2 women. We can break it down by the number
	of women selected:
	\[
		\binom{6}{2}\binom{5}{2} \;+\;
		\binom{6}{3}\binom{5}{1} \;+\;
		\binom{6}{4}\binom{5}{0}.
	\]
	Here, \(\binom{6}{k}\) chooses the women, and \(\binom{5}{4-k}\) chooses
	the men for each scenario. Summing these counts gives the total number
	of ways to form such a committee.
}

\ex{Committee with Subgroups Required}{
	Say we have 10 people, of whom 3 are Teaching Assistants (TAs) and 7 are
	Professors, and we wish to form a committee of 4 people \emph{with exactly
		2 TAs}. We select 2 from the 3 TAs and 2 from the 7 Professors, yielding
	\[
		\binom{3}{2} \;\times\; \binom{7}{2}
	\]
	possible committees.
}

\ex{Larger Committees: Multiple Constraints}{
	Suppose there are 12 people divided into three categories: 4 from group
	A, 5 from group B, and 3 from group C. We want a committee of 5 that
	has at least 1 person from each group. One way to count is to enumerate
	possible splits of 5 among \((A,B,C)\), ensuring each category has at
	least one representative. For instance:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 1 from A, 3 from B, 1 from C,
		\item 1 from A, 2 from B, 2 from C,
		\item 2 from A, 2 from B, 1 from C,
		\item and so forth,
	\end{itemize}
	and sum the corresponding products of binomial coefficients
	\(\binom{4}{\dots}\binom{5}{\dots}\binom{3}{\dots}\).
}

\nt{
	These examples illustrate the typical approaches to \emph{committee
		choosing} problems:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Identify if order matters (usually it does not, hence combinations).
		\item If there are constraints (e.g.\ minimum number of members from a certain
		      group), split the problem into valid cases and sum their respective counts.
	\end{itemize}
}

\ex{Probability of Getting a Flush in Poker}{
	A \emph{flush} in poker is a hand where all 5 cards are of the same suit.
	To calculate the probability of being dealt a flush, we proceed as follows:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item There are 4 suits in a deck (hearts, diamonds, clubs, spades).
		\item For each suit, there are \(\binom{13}{5}\) ways to choose 5 cards from the 13 available.
		\item Thus, the total number of ways to get a flush is \(4 \times \binom{13}{5}\).
		\item The total number of 5-card hands from a 52-card deck is \(\binom{52}{5}\).
	\end{itemize}

	Therefore, the probability \(P\) of being dealt a flush is given by
	\[
		P(\text{flush}) = \frac{\binom{4}{1} \times \binom{13}{5}}{\binom{52}{5}}.
	\]

	So, the probability of being dealt a flush in poker is approximately 0.198\%.
